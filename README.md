To start the project you need to run the back-end and front-end separately <br>

# Sample Hardhat Project (back-end)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Start the project front-end

```shell
npm run dev
```
