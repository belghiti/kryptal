# Sample Hardhat Project 

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.<br>

You may need to change configuration in ./solidity/hardhat.config.js

Try running some of the following tasks in the ./solidity directory:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Start the project front-end - Simple React App bootstraped with vite

```shell
npm run dev
```
